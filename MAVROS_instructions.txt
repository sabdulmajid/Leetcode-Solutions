If you are not seeing any specific output or simulation activity, it's possible that the Gazebo simulation environment is not launching properly or there may be issues with the connection between Gazebo and MAVROS. Let's try the following steps to launch the simulation and visualize it in Gazebo:

1. **Stop the current running processes:** In your terminal, where you launched the `roslaunch` command, press `Ctrl+C` to stop the running `roslaunch` process. This will terminate the current simulation setup.

2. **Launch Gazebo:** Open a new terminal and launch Gazebo by running the following command:
   ```
   gazebo --verbose
   ```
   This command will launch Gazebo and provide verbose output, which can help in identifying any issues during the launch process.

3. **Launch the simulation with Gazebo:** In a separate terminal, run the `roslaunch` command to launch the simulation environment with Gazebo. Use the following command:
   ```
   roslaunch mavros apm.launch fcu_url:=udp://:14550@ gcs_url:=udp://@
   ```

4. **Observe Gazebo GUI:** Gazebo should launch with the simulated environment and display a graphical user interface (GUI) showing the quadcopter model. You should see a virtual world, including the quadcopter and possibly other objects depending on the simulation setup.

5. **Verify MAVROS connection:** In the `roslaunch` terminal, ensure that the MAVROS node is running and successfully connected to the quadcopter. Look for the line `[ INFO] [MAVConnInterfaceUDP.cc:729] Interface: 0.0.0.0:14550, local: ????.` indicating a successful connection.

6. **Publish the takeoff command:** Open a new terminal and run the `rostopic pub` command to publish the takeoff command:
   ```
   rostopic pub /mavros/setpoint_position/local geometry_msgs/PoseStamped "{
     header: {
       seq: 0,
       stamp: {secs: 0, nsecs: 0},
       frame_id: ''
     },
     pose: {
       position: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 2.0},
       orientation: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0, w: 0.0}
     }
   }"
   ```

7. **Observe Gazebo simulation:** Keep an eye on the Gazebo GUI to see if the quadcopter takes off and moves to the specified position. You should see the quadcopter model responding to the takeoff command.

If you are still facing issues or not seeing the expected simulation activity, please provide any error messages or additional details observed during the process. Additionally, make sure your system meets the requirements for running Gazebo simulations, and check the documentation and support channels for Gazebo, MAVROS, and ArduPilot for further assistance.
